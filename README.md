# Description
This Android app retrieves a random "yo momma" joke from the Internet and displays it in a text view every time the app is opened. To get a new joke, you will have to force close the app and open it again.

# Demonstration
YouTube video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIo_HLMIRgY&feature=youtube_gdata

# Source Code
See 'master' branch in GitHub.

# Notes and Instructions
I cannot guarantee the jokes are SFW...

I also put a joke in there intially, so the first joke that loads is from the strings.xml file. Everything after that pulls from the Internet.

# References
The jokes come from an API from this site: http://www.yomomma.info/
