# Description
This Android app retrieves a random "yo momma" joke from the Internet and displays it in a text view every time the app is opened. To get a new joke, you will have to force close the app and open it again.

# Demonstration
Soon...

# Source Code
See 'master' branch in GitHub.

# Notes and Instructions
I cannot guarantee the jokes are SFW...

# References
The jokes come from an API from this site: http://www.yomomma.info/
